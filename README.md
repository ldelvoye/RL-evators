# RL-tutorial

Quick research project to learn the basics of reinforcement learning using tensorflow.
This is a reinforcement learning implementation of gymnasium's cart pole, done without following any particular tutorial.
Since this is my first RL project, I'm not expecting any part of the code to be particularly optimized.
